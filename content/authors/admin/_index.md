TBD

<!-- I usually use natural language processing to build community health and recommendation systems.

My main scope of work ranges from machine learning problem finding to data analysis, modeling, and building APIs on AWS.

I'm interested in implementing AI in society to contribute to service growth and improve the numbers.

like / good
- The ability to produce 80% of the output quickly.
- It is easier to produce results as a team than to push forward alone.
- Committed to results
- Making others laugh (and sometimes stretching yourself)
- Baseball and Sports

dislike / not good
- Scolding people.
- Speaking in front of a lot of people (but I like LT, etc.) -->
